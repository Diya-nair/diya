    <div>
        <p>Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa seed kernels that is available as a liquid,
            solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cocoa has been consumed in some
            form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador. Later
            Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages, and it was introduced to Europe in the 16th
            century.</p>

        <p>Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving
            chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate
            chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made
            of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded
            into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays,
            including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot
            beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.

        <p>A 2020 report estimated that more than 1.5 million children are involved in the farming of cocoa in CÃ´te
            d'Ivoire and Ghana.[1] Child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns.
            A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure
            because of persistent poverty, the absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming
            of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.</p>
