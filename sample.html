He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management from Purdue University and worked as a business manager in Dubai before pursuing a career in acting.

    <p>After a three-month acting course at the Barry John Acting Studio, Salmaan made his acting debut with Second Show (2012). He has since established himself as a leading actor in Indian cinema with several critically and commercially successful films including Ustad Hotel (2012), ABCD (2013), Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi (2013), Vaayai Moodi Pesavum (2014), Bangalore Days (2014), Vikramadithyan (2014), O Kadhal Kanmani (2015), Charlie (2015), Kali (2016), Kammatti Paadam (2016), Jomonte Suvisheshangal (2017), Mahanati (2018), Kurup (2021) and Sita Ramam (2022).[6][7][8][9][10]</p>

    <h2>EARLY FAMILY LIFE</h2>
    <p>Dulquer Salmaan was born on 28 July 1983/1986 in Kochi.[15] He is the youngest son of the actor Mammootty. He completed his primary level education at Toc-H Public School, Vyttila, Kochi and his secondary level education at Sishya School in Chennai.[16] He has a bachelor's degree in Business Management from Purdue University and worked at an IT firm in Dubai.[17] Later, bored by the monotony of corporate life, he decided to pursue a career in acting and attended a three-month course at the Barry John Acting Studio in Mumbai</p>

    <p>In 2011, Salmaan signed on for debutante Srinath Rajendran's crime film Second Show (2012) in which he played the role of Harilal, a gangster. When asked in an interview about his "unconventional entry with a bunch of newcomers", Salmaan stated that it was his conscious decision as he felt that " ... when an actor debuts, he has to earn the right to be a hero and not get it through a shortcut route."[23] The film was a commercial success.</p>

    <p>Salmaan next starred in Anwar Rasheed's Ustad Hotel (2012). The film, which received the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, was also a major commercial success at the box office.[26] He also won widespread praise for his portrayal of Faizy, a budding chef.[27] For his performance, Salmaan won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – Malayalam, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Malayalam.[28][29] His third film was Theevram, a crime thriller directed by Roopesh Peethambaran. The film, which released in November 2012, was a box office failure.</p>
